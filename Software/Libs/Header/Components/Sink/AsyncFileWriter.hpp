/**
 ******************************************************************************
 * @file    AsyncFileWriter.hpp
 * @brief   Base async file writer: worker thread, flush policy, size rollover.
 *
 * Owns everything common to a background file writer - the worker thread, the
 * file handle, the flush (f_sync) policy and size-based segment rollover. The
 * only variation point is where the bytes come from: subclasses implement
 * @ref produce(), fed either by a queue (PushFileWriter) or by a pull source
 * (PullFileWriter).
 *
 * Naming on rollover is delegated outward via a @ref NextPathFn callback, so
 * this class stays free of any session/naming policy (see Sink::SessionNaming).
 *
 * @warning produce() is called from the worker thread and is pure virtual, so
 *          every subclass MUST call stop() in its own destructor - otherwise the
 *          worker may dispatch produce() while the subclass is already destroyed
 *          (a pure-virtual call). The base destructor calls stop() only as a
 *          backstop.
